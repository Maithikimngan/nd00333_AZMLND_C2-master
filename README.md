# MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT 2

In this project, I will work with the Bank Marketing dataset to run the model. Using Azure Machine Learning Studio, I will deploy the model. I will create and publish a pipeline. This project shows my skills in using AutoML, deploying the best model, enabling logging for monitoring, creating Swagger documentation for APIs, and consuming model endpoints effectively. I have already deploy the endpoint and run it already.
